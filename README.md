# Create Metro App
This is just cli to clone app boilerplates arranged by MetroCorp Teams.
## How To Run
Just run this command 
```
pnpm create appmetro
```

Or you can specify project name
```
pnpm create appmetro project-name
```

> [!NOTE]
> why appmetro, not metro-app? Because there is npm package was named to create-metro and create-metro-app and contains no code ðŸ˜

All boilerplate should be placed into `presets` folder.
